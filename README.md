Snooks and Ladders is a procedurally generated wallpaper pattern in Javascript composed of Snooks (Snake geese) and Ladders. 

This uses the p5.js library for graphics. 

Generation is driven using a wave function collapse greedy algorithm and the socket system to define tile rules. 
Snooks and Ladders can also be found here on OpenProcessing: oppr.org/s/DXecRWxy
